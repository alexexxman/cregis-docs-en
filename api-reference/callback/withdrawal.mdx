## Callback API

_The callback URL is provided in request body by the request initiator. For more details, see the `callback_url` parameter in the [Create withdrawal order](/api-reference/request-apis/withdrawal/withdrawal-create)._

This API allows `cregis` to initiate callback request to the original API caller. 

The callback comes in four scenarios, which are determined by the `status` in the callback content. These scenarios are mutually exclusive and only trigger once:

| status | Description            |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| 2      | Signature Rejected     |
| 4      | Approval Rejected      |
| 6      | Transaction Succeeded |
| 7      | Transaction Failed     |

After initiating the callback, when the returned content is `success`, the callback is successful. Otherwise, the callback fails. If the callback fails, you can push it again, you can log into the `cregis` client, select the corresponding project in the menu, and re-push it from the callback record.

> Note: Different types of callbacks will have different content. It is strongly recommended to use different APIs for different types of callbacks to ensure clear and specific business logic.
